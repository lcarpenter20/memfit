utilities.py 

This script when imported as a module allows search.py, transform.py and 
assemble.py in the ah package to run smoothly. 

This file contains the following functions:

    * add_annotations - Adds annotations to each pair of repeated structures 
    according to their length and order of occurence. 

    * create_sdm - Creates a self-dissimilarity matrix; this matrix is found 
    by creating audio shingles from feature vectors, and finding cosine 
    distance between shingles. 

    * find_initial_repeats - Finds all diagonals present in thresh_mat, 
    removing each diagonal as it is found.
    
    * reconstruct_full_block - Creates a record of when pairs of repeated
    structures occur, from the first beat in the song to the last beat of the
    song. Pairs of repeated structures are marked with 1's. 
    
    * reformat - Transforms a binary matrix representation of when repeats 
    occur in a song into a list of repeated structures detailing the length
    and occurence of each repeat.      
    
    * stretch_diags - Fill out diagonals in binary self dissimilarity matrix
    from diagonal starts and lengths

def reformat(pattern_mat, pattern_key):

    Transforms a binary array with 1's where repeats start and 0's
    otherwise into an a list of repeated stuctures. This list consists of
    information about the repeats including length, when they occur and when
    they end. 
    
    Every row has a pair of repeated structure. The first two columns are 
    the time steps of when the first repeat of a repeated structure start and 
    end. Similarly, the second two columns are the time steps of when the 
    second repeat of a repeated structure start and end. The fourth colum is 
    the length of the repeated structure.
